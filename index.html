					<p>Hello, My name is Ishan Krishana Sharma. I Was born in Agra, Brought up in Morena and belongs to vrindavan.  I did my school education form Morena itself. For graduation i went to gwalior and join ITM UNIVERSITY. I did B.Tech in Electronics & Communication branch and persuded 72 percentage. I got recruited by INFOSYS during palcement held at my university. I went for the professinal training in INFOSYS.
					I did my major training from the India's well renowned and one the "Nav-ratan" Company named BHEL (Bharat Heavy Electricals limited) Bhopal. In my family we are 4 members including me. My father,mother and an elder brother.I am a big follower of 3D's of life that are "Determination,Dedication,Dicipline". I think if a person posses with these 3 qualities which i prefer to say 3D's of life then he can achieve whatever he wants. There would not such a thing which we can not do but we have to determine for it. I am a big influencer of these qualities. I have many  hobbies and most of them i do in daily basis. Some of the hobbies include reading Books like any book but should be informative, in my sapre time i would like to do YOGA. It heals my all the pressure and makes me healthy and fresh and full of energy.</p>
